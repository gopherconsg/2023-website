description = "Since the dawn of computing, we've interacted with computers using the text-based Command Line Interface (CLI). Today, even with the dominance of graphical interfaces, CLIs are often paired with company APIs to boost platform engagement or used in cloud infrastructure. In my talk, I'll dive into the CLI's structure, the principles for building an effective one, and showcase hands-on examples with some of Go's most popular frameworks."
